      <p>Anyone else notice the weird stuff going on in Central City lately? I swear I saw a flying car the other day. And there have been reports of people with superpowers. What the hell is happening? I fear for my life every day now.</p>

       <p>Yeah I've seen some crazy shit too. Couple nights ago I could have sworn I saw a guy shoot lasers from his eyes. Thought maybe I had too much to drink but seems like others have seen similar things. We're all gonna die, aren't we?</p>

      <p>Wake up sheeple! The government has been experimenting on citizens, giving them weird powers. It's all part of their plan for world domination. Don't believe the lies on the news! The end is near, prepare yourselves.</p>

      <p>I used to work security at Capsule Corp. Let me tell you, that place has some dark secrets. I've personally seen them working on some kind of portal to another dimension in the basement labs. Pretty sure that's where these "superhumans" are coming from. They'll kill me if they find out I'm posting this.</p>

      <p>Believe what you want but I know what I saw. Something seriously shady is going on over there. Wouldn't be surprised if Mrs. Briefs herself isn't entirely human... If I go missing, you know why.

        <p>So am I the only one who thinks the World Martial Arts Tournament is completely rigged? Every year it's won by the same group of weirdos with gravity-defying hair. They have to be bribing the judges or something. It's all a scam to distract us from what's really going on!</p>

      <p>Alright fellow truth-seekers, get a load of this. That freak of nature Goku has to be from another planet. No way a human could do the shit he does. I think "Saiyan" is just code for extraterrestrial. He's probably here to scout for an invasion! We need to eliminate him before it's too late.</p>

      <p>You might be on to something... I was at the Cell Games and saw Goku and his buddies pull off some physics-defying stunts. And wasn't his kid the one who actually beat Cell? No normal child has that kind of power! They're not human, I'm telling you.</p>

      <p>Even if Goku is an alien, I think he's one of the good ones. Dude literally died to save the Earth from Raditz and sacrificed himself again during the Cell Games. And his son is dating that Satan girl so they're like integrating with humans. But who knows, maybe it's all part of their plan...</p>

      <p>Open your eyes man, it's all a clever ruse! I bet the Saiyans have infiltrated the world government. Even King Furry is probably a reptilian shapeshifter at this point. We're all doomed unless we expose them! Trust no one, not even your own family. They could be Saiyan spies.</p>

      <p>I still have nightmares about being absorbed by Cell. It was like my body disintegrated and my mind merged into this disgusting hivemind thing. And then suddenly I was back, not knowing if it was real or not. I feel so alone. Is there anyone else out there who went through this hell? I'm scared it will happen again...</p>

      <p>You're not alone friend. A bunch of us Cell victims meet up every week to talk through our trauma. I'll DM you the details. It's a safe space, no judging. We're all just trying to process the fact that we literally died. But be careful who you trust, I hear Cell had spies everywhere.</p>

      <p>I'm honestly scared to go. Like if we all suddenly came back, does that mean death is meaningless? What if Cell comes back too and absorbs us all over again? I don't know what's real anymore. Maybe this is all still happening in Cell's twisted mind.</p>

     <p>You have nothing to fear, the power of the Dragon Balls brought us back for good. I've seen them work miracles with my own eyes. Cell is gone for good and we've been given a second chance at life! But the eternal dragon's power is not to be trifled with. There may be consequences to resurrection we cannot fathom.</p>

      <p>I want to believe that but it all seems so unreal still. I guess I'll try coming to a meeting though. It would be nice to talk to people who actually understand. Hopefully it helps me feel alive again. If not, there's always the sweet embrace of death to look forward to...</p>

      <p>I can't be the only one completely enamored with Android 18. She's the perfect combination of beauty and danger. I would let her step on me any day. I've started a shrine to worship her unparalleled allure.</p>

      <p>Oh I feel you bro. Android 18 awakened something in me I never knew existed. The idea of a gorgeous but deadly artificial being is just too intoxicating. I would drain my life savings just for her to insult me to my face.</p>

      <p>You fools are going to get yourselves killed simping over a killing machine. I heard she's married to that little bald dude Krillin anyway. You really think you could satisfy an android in ways a superhuman martial artist can't? Keep dreaming, meatbags.</p>

      <p>Krillin doesn't deserve Android 18, simple as that. I'm currently working on a VR simulation that would let me live out my wildest cybernetic fantasies starring my beloved deadly waifu. Will post the shady download link once it's complete, for all my fellow 18 stans out there.</p>

      <p>Shut up Broly, literally nobody asked you. Go jerk off to your own legendary form somewhere else. This is a Kefla worship zone. I heard a rumor she likes bad boys, maybe I should start wearing black and scowling more...
